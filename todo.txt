Some items to cover:

-draw streets
-follow lines / curves
-zoom in and out of the overall map
-implement traffic lights w/logic
-implement driver disposition (timid / normal / aggresive)
-implement driver motive; ie destination based driving and pathfinding

-add music perhaps?

-add some rudimentary sensors?
-investigate flocking behaviour for lanes?

-use radius to determine 'flocking' behaviour

Need to make a small vector lib -- neat discovery!
Math.hypot:

//calculate length of a vector [5, 12]
console.log(Math.hypot(5, 12));
console.log(Math.sqrt(5*5 + 12*12));

both return 13
